The Guessing Game is a simple Python program that generates a random number between 1 and a user-specified upper bound, and then prompts the user to guess the number. The program gives feedback on each guess, letting the user know whether their guess was too high or too low. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the random number.

## Getting Started

To use the Guessing Game, simply run the `guessing_game.py` script in a Python environment. The program will prompt you for the highest possible number to guess, and then guide you through the game.

## How to Play

1. Run the `guessing_game.py` script in a Python environment.
2. When prompted, enter the highest possible number you want to guess. The game will generate a random number between 1 and this value.
3. The program will prompt you to enter a guess. Enter a number between 1 and the highest possible number.
4. The program will give you feedback on your guess, telling you whether your guess is too high or too low.
5. Continue guessing until you correctly guess the random number.
6. Once you guess the correct number, the program will congratulate you and exit.
